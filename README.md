# Streamlined VFIO setup
This guide is originally a PDF I made over the time I have used VFIO and wrote down all my settings, tips and performance tweaks to make VFIO run as smooth as possible.

This project is here to slowly convert this whole PDF into markdown so everything can be hosted on github and contributed to.

For now until everything is converted, the PDF is included in the actual repository.

The document is aimed at Ubuntu18.04, but I would like to have it cover other distributions I am not familiar with, hence why I put the finished document on github.

If you want to help, the best way you can do that is to fork the project, write more of the PDF into markdown and issue a pull request!


Layout will be (still work in progress! suggestions welcome!)

<pre>TOC.md
sections/sectionname1/title1.md
sections/sectionname1/title2.md
sections/sectionname1/title3.md
sections/sectionname2/title1.md
</pre>

where sectionname is the topic covered and title is the title for the "chapters" of the different parts in the section.
Keep in mind that this is all still work in progress.
